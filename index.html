  <p class = "preach">Riding mountain bikes competitively does more for a person than just making them look silly in spandex and chuncky helmets.
Riding hard <em>pushes the limits</em> of previous achievments. Let's you know what you're capable of. Where your weaknesses are, your strengths, and your opportunities for greatness. It gives you a community. Globally. You give back, <em>locally</em>.
<br /> <br />Volunteer with your local <em>Trips for Kids</em> chapter to connect at-risk youth with the natural world and show them the joys of mountain biking and living a healthy lifestyle. You can also visit the <em>International Mountain Bike Associations (IMBA)</em> website to volunteer your time either fighting for mountain bike advocacy or even getting your hands dirty with local trail building and maintenance. </p>
